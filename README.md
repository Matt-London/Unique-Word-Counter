# mostWords

This program is used to determine the greatest number of unique words used within a certain text. Whether it is song lyrics, a poem, or a speech it will all work.

In order to use it, put all text headings (like authors name) in a file and put the text you would like to check immediately after it on however many lines. Then at the end of the file put 10 hyphens like so: "----------"
And put as many more texts to follow as you please. Then when running the program specify the file path after the name, for example:

./words.py test.txt

python3 words.py test.txt

Enjoy!
